Name of Quantlet: FPCAreal_data

Published in: 'Functional Principal Component Analysis for Derivatives of High-Dimensional Spatial Curves'

Description: 'Estimates state price densities (SPD) from a sample of discretely observed and noisy call price curves at different time to maturity and strike prices. Use FPCA decomposition of the dual covariance matrix and estimate functional components of the SPD and their corresponding loadings.'

Keywords: estimation, FPCA, call prices, derivative, density, state price density, risk neutral density
