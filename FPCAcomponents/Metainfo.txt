Name of Quantlet: FPCAcomponents

Published in: 'Functional Principal Component Analysis for Derivatives of High-Dimensional Spatial Curves'

Description: 'It interpolates the estimated functional components at a common grid and plots them, together with the estimates loadings time series.'

Keywords: estimation, FPCA, call prices, derivative, density, state price density, risk neutral density, functional components, time series, loadings

Input:
- Results.mat          : Output of FPCAreal_data.m
- vdaxm.txt            : VDAX index time series (same date as the loadings)
- xData.txt            : date time series
- Is.txt               : index for the time series of loadings
- tickdatayear.txt     : tick years

Output: 'It plots the functional components and the corresponding loadings.'
