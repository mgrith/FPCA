Input:
            - Results.mat          : Output of FPCAreal_data.m
            - vdaxm.txt            : VDAX index time series (same date as the loadings)
            - xData.txt            : date time series
            - Is.txt               : index for the time series of loadings
            - tickdatayear.txt     : tick years

Output:
            - b          : autoregressive coefficients
            - s          : standard deviation of the error
            - varcorr    : pairwise error correlation
            - volv       : standard deviation of the VDAX index
